# inigochoa

Just a business card.

## Usage

With `npm` installed, run:

```console
npx @inigochoa/card
```

And the output should be:

![Output result][output]

> Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this
> as a global command. That'd be creepy.

## Development

To test and see changes in the card, run:

```console
yarn dev
```
